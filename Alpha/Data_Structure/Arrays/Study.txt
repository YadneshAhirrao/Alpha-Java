In Java, the == operator is used to compare the references of objects, not their actual content. When comparing strings using ==, you are checking whether two string references point to the exact same memory location, rather than checking if the content of the strings is equal.

To compare the content of strings, you should use the equals() method. In your isFoodPresent method, you should modify the comparison from k == str to k.equals(str).
